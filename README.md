<p>Machine translation is a popular topic in research with new papers coming out every year. Over the years of research, different methods were created, like  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule-based_machine_translation">rule-based</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_machine_translation">statistical</a>, and  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Example-based_machine_translation">example-based</a>  machine translation. With all this effort, itâ€™s still an unsolved problem. However, neural networks have made a large leap forward in machine translation.</p>
<p>In this notebook, you will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.</p>
